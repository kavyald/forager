# Package Contents

WHAT TO DO: Describe the contained functions for each file; what they're used for. More general descriptions, as fewer people will look at the README. We want to make sure say if we (or external contributors/collaborators) in the future want to update the package, or new lab members managing the package can easily understand how to modify the code or add to it
