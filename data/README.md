# Data Contents

The following folder is used to store any required dependencies in terms of data to execute Semantic Foraging methods. 

This may include: 
- Similarity/Phonological Cue Matrices
- Frequency Data Lists
- Norms Data 
- Common Benchmark Datasets (e.g. Psych Review data)


If you would like to introduce any new data not already existing in the data folder, please create a new subfolder with a representative name. You might also consider adding subfolders to the subfolder, to indicate the source of the data  

For example, if you are uploading required items for psych-review data analysis you might consider adding the following paths:

- /data/benchmark/psy-rev/DATA_FILE_NAME
- /data/norms/troyer/DATA_FILE_NAME
- /data/frequency/googlenews/DATA_FILE_NAME
- /data/similarity/word2vec_wiki/DATA_FILE_NAME

It is important to disambiguate different sources of data, to ensure easy to follow structures in data retrieval.
